| Language            | Type          |
| Python              | Interpret     |
| C                   | Compiled      |
| C++                 | Compiled      |
| Perl                | Interpret     |
| Ruby                | Interpret     |
| Javascript          | Interpret     |


## Question 2
Since python is an interpretted language while C++ is compiled, an obvious benefit to using python would be its flexibility across multiple different devices and simpler natures, making it easier to debug
For example, if a website such as wikipedia offered users the ability to add their own knowledge and information to topics, python would be a better choice here. Not only would it be easier and less time consuming
because of python being a simpler language, but people with different devices can all access the open source due to python being interpretted.
